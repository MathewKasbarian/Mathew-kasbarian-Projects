# CSCI / MATH 2072U - Computational Science 1

## Assignment 1
### Deadline:  17:00 EST on January 15, 2021
This assignment is aimed at introducing you to the GitHub Classroom workflow that will be used in throughout the course. In addition, the assignment also serves as a tool to introduce you to basic equation formatting with Latex. Finish the following tasks, commit and push your changes to your repository before the assignment deadline. 

__1. Python__\
In your repo, you'll find a template file named `HelloWorld.py`. Modify the function `HelloWorld()` so that it takes a `string name` as an input argument and returns the string `"Hello <input name>!"`.

For example: If the input is `"John Doe"`, the function should return `"Hello John Doe!"`

__2. LaTex__\
Use a LaTex editor to typset the following equations:

Once you have typeset the equations, upload a PDF titled `equations.pdf` containing all the typeset equations to your assignment repository.\
To help you, a starter Latex template called `equations.tex` is available in the repository. You can use any Latex editor of your preference such as [TeXmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/), [Texstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/), etc. You can also use online Latex editors such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or visual mathematical editors such as [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/Home).

__3. Bonus__\
Push the changes you made to `equations.tex` file. The file should reflect all the changes you made in order to arrive at the final PDF with the equations that you have uploaded.

In case of any questions or doubts, ask the instructor or the teaching assistants for help through the slack channel `#assignment_1`.
